# Plant-Health-Monitor
Summary - In this project I have collected urban garden plants data and trained the model to detect the condition of the plant provide apt plant care suggestions

The Story -
One evening as I was watering my plants, I  noticed that the hydrangea plant which I had brought just a week ago was looking dull and about to wilt. Which saddened me,
as I loved the flowers and had lovingly bought the plant for a price. And as I was thinking how Good it would be if I had an app which could tell me what's the issue with the plant using its image and I could
take care of the plant accordingly. And thus was the birth of the idea behind this app and began the frantic search for data collection. And the journey of training the model and making it into realtime application. 

Currently the model is undergoing training and I shall keep uploading the progress. Stay tuned! :)
